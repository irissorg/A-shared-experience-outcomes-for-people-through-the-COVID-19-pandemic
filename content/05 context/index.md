There are similarities between the key experiences described in the stories with other (survey-based) research conducted in 2020 by Community Care ([surveys](https://www.communitycare.co.uk/2020/05/28/social-workers-say-coronavirus-negatively-affected-services-people-they-support/)), the Scottish Government ([Everyone Matters) ](../files/everyone-matters-pulse-survey-national-report-2020-final-version.pdf)and ARC Scotland ([Weâ€™re All in This Together](https://arcscotland.org.uk/resources/publications/were-all-in-this-together-the-impact-of-covid-19-on-the-future-of-social-care-in-scotland-a-view-from-the-workforce/)). Some key similarities from across these three sources include:

* Staff felt motivated, committed and proud of their work during lockdown
* Support from colleagues and managers was key to staff motivation and wellbeing
* Collaborative working being identified as one of the good things to come out of the pandemic
* Staff were pleasantly surprised at the adaptability of supported people during this time
* Improved partnership working - key enablers being a shared vision and information sharing
* Staff enjoying more flexibility (including working from home), regular communication and welcoming technology, while also being concerned about the digital divide.
* In research conducted later in the year staff reported exhaustion, fatigue and worries about the future.
* A hope for the future to move away from prescriptive, service-led interventions towards a more flexible, person-centred approach.

Concerns raised in our stories about the impact of COVID-19 on existing poverty, food insecurity and deprivation are also widely recognised in other research, for example, [The Health Foundation report on health inequalities](https://www.health.org.uk/publications/long-reads/will-covid-19-be-a-watershed-moment-for-health-inequalities); [GPs at the deep end report 36](https://www.gla.ac.uk/media/Media_728030_smxx.pdf), and [Oxfam research on carers](https://policy-practice.oxfam.org/resources/care-poverty-and-coronavirus-across-britain-620980/) to highlight a few.
