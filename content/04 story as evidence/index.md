> We are, as a species, addicted to story. Even when the body goes to sleep, the mind stays up all night, telling itself stories.  
**The storytelling animal: how stories make us human, Jonathan Gottschall, 2012**

The power of sharing stories is [well documented](https://www.iriss.org.uk/resources/insights/role-personal-storytelling-practice). Stories can sometimes be dismissed as anecdotes or thought of as sitting at the bottom of evidence hierarchies. However, they are vital to help us deepen our understanding of our experiences and those of others. This is perhaps especially true and valuable [during a global pandemic](https://www.scie.org.uk/care-providers/coronavirus-covid-19/blogs/covid-19-stories).

Story as a form of evidence is also fitting for a project focused on a personal outcomes approach. Identifying personal outcomes involves gathering information about what an individual describes as being important to them in life, any barriers they are facing, and understanding the meaning they attach to these factors. It is important to understand a person’s story in order to uncover and support what matters most to them.

## How did people feel about sharing their stories?

The storytellers were asked about the impact of telling these stories. All responded positively, feeling the project had given them valuable opportunities to share their story, and learn from those of others. Some appreciated the opportunity to reflect and ‘take a step back’, while for others it was a way to help them process the trauma they had experienced.

> It’s good to reflect on this journey and think about how far we have come, and think about the things we have gained, as well as the things we have lost  
**Sally**

> It has made me pay more attention to the dynamics within my family and it is cathartic to get it down on paper  
**Denise**

> It’s been really nice to reflect on what this period has really been like for me. I have thought about it a lot but this has felt like I have been given a platform to voice my feelings. Thanks.  
**Paula**

> Being able to share the learning and read how other people have adapted to working during this pandemic has been invaluable.  
**Keir**

There was an awareness that what we’re living through had historical importance and it was vital to capture these experiences for the future.

> This project is a bit like Samuel Pepys diary.  
**Wilma**

> I feel that telling my story - it’s a bit like contributing to a time capsule... this will pass in time and people will want to learn about how this was and how we got through it. It’s good to contribute to that in a small way.
