# Introduction

## About this resource

This resource brings together the learning from a collection of stories gathered by the [Personal Outcomes Network](https://personaloutcomes.network/the-personal-outcomes-network/) (PON) throughout 2020. It was developed to share stories of the experiences of those working across a range of sectors to keep a focus on outcomes for people during an extended public health emergency. By presenting a detailed analysis of these stories and how experiences evolved throughout the year, we’re able to make sense of what this crisis has meant for outcomes for people and draw out implications to inform practice, policy and recovery.

This project collected the stories across three phases in 2020 which is reflected in the structure of this resource.

* Phase 1: Response to crisis - spring / summer 2020
* Phase 2: Continuity and endurance - autumn 2020
* Phase 3: Looking to the future and recovery - winter 2020 / 2021

The prompts in Phase 3 provide a practical aspect, helping you connect your experiences with those shared in this resource. Similar to our [Outcomes & Co tool](https://www.iriss.org.uk/resources/tools/outcomes-co), these could be used as a framework for conversations in supervision, team meetings, partner discussions or for individual reflection.

Use of this resource contributes to the following outcomes:

* Increased awareness and clarity about an outcomes approach in general and in times of crisis
* Improved understanding of the experience of those striving to work towards  outcomes for people through the pandemic
* Improved understanding of the conditions which support practitioners, promote resilience and facilitate personal outcomes
* Increased awareness and understanding of the implications of the stories to support planning and recovery from the pandemic
* Increased awareness and knowledge about story as a form of evidence

## Evaluation

We’d love to hear your feedback on this resource, how you’ve used it and what, if any, difference it’s made. [This short survey](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/sharedexperience) will take five minutes and will be really helpful to inform future resource development.

## Why it’s unique

The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a keen interest in gathering research and stories about the impact of the crisis on those on the frontline (eg [Inspiring Care Stories](https://www.sssc.uk.com/careers-and-education/inspiring-care-stories/) and [Stories of Promise](https://www.thinklocalactpersonal.org.uk/covid-19/social-care-provision-stories-of-promise/)). What makes this collection unique is that it focuses specifically on an outcomes approach during the pandemic and evidences how practice has responded to keep this focus through the crisis. It also took snapshots at three different points during the pandemic. The first point was during the initial crisis response in the spring followed by the second wave in the autumn. In winter we carried out in-depth interviews with eight of the storytellers to unpack their stories further, and held a workshop in early February 2021 with PON members and some of the storytellers to sense check key themes and capture further experiences.

This resource is also unique in the diversity of the storytellers.  As with membership of the PON, our 41 storytellers come from diverse sectors including the NHS; social work and social care; the third sector; care home sector; and primary and higher education. It also included a carer whose mother with dementia moved in during lockdown.

Where some collections bring stories together, this resource goes further by providing an analysis and drawing out implications. It also includes a practical aspect with reflective prompts, and film and audio clips to bring the stories to life.

# Personal outcomes

In Scotland there is growing commitment across the health and social care system to focus on the outcomes important to children and adults using services and support, as well as their families and unpaid carers. Personal outcomes are like goals but tend to represent broader themes of wellbeing and quality of life. They also include themes which promote positive relationships in life in general, as well as with practitioners. Identifying, capturing and working collaboratively towards personal outcomes involves building trust and getting to know the person, and building a story of their life and priorities to influence decisions. There are important factors to consider about the focus on outcomes during the pandemic.  During the initial crisis response the main concern was to ensure that core collective _outcomes for people_ requiring support were attended to. As time went on and staff were more able to engage with people, it became possible to refocus on _personal outcomes_, on a more individualised basis. Practitioner stories illustrate this shift over time. On balance, this heart captures the most commonly identified outcomes in our stories:

# The Stories Project

This project was initiated by the Personal Outcomes Network (PON) which exists to provide a space for people working across services to connect, share knowledge and experiences and to influence policy in ways that keeps the focus on what matters to people. A multi-agency co-ordinating group plans activities and engages with wider policy agendas. Before COVID-19, we hosted quarterly meetings to focus on themes identified as important to our members, including personal planning, conversations, communication support needs, staff supervision and working with carers.

From March 2020 the co-ordinating group started to turn attention to the changing context of service delivery in the pandemic.  We asked members to contribute stories of how they were staying focused on outcomes during a time of great challenge.  This included outcomes for supported people and unpaid carers, as well as for staff, as represented in our heart diagram. It is important to acknowledge that these stories are not intended to be representative of all staff experiences.  We sought examples where people were able to keep focusing on outcomes, despite the challenges.  However, while these stories, therefore, lean towards more positive experiences, and the intention was to promote ways of managing, coping and achieving outcomes at this difficult time, the challenges and difficulties come through strongly too.

All stories can be accessed from the [Personal Outcomes Network website](https://personaloutcomes.network/).

## Methods / phases

### Phase 1: April 2020 - August 2020

#### April

* Story template developed

#### May

* Call for stories to PON members and on Twitter

#### May - July

* 39 stories collected. 24 people recorded their own story and 15 chose to be interviewed, have their story written, retaining editorial control. The majority of storytellers were happy to have their names on their stories, with only a couple asking to remain anonymous.
* Stories were tweeted daily as a way of sharing practice timeously.
* The first stories were analysed thematically to inform a presentation hosted by NES as part of a webinar held in June on [wellbeing in the pandemic](https://vimeo.com/433717583).

### Phase 2: September 2020 - November 2020

* Updated template developed and shared with storytellers
* 20 stories collected with 11 people recording their own stories and nine co-produced as before. These were also tweeted daily.
* Second stories analysed thematically to inform a second webinar, [Meaningful conversations in a virtual world](https://vimeo.com/486438202), hosted by NES in November.

### Phase 3: December 2020 - March 2021

* Agreement to produce an online resource to share learning about practice and outcomes, with some final stories to collect.
* Eight storytellers were approached to be interviewed and provide updates. They were selected to represent diverse sectors, genders, roles, and approaches.
* Online PON workshop hosted in February to check priorities for the resource and to collect wider stories and examples. The 30 participants included 25 network members, including several of the storytellers and the network co-ordinating group. Attendees came from the health and social care sectors and from across Scotland including Shetland, Fife, Falkirk, Dundee, Glasgow, Inverclyde, the Scottish Borders and the Lothians.
* All stories revisited and data from new interviews and workshop notes analysed.
* Draft resource shared with storytellers and PON co-ordinating group for feedback.
* Production of the final resource.

# Story as evidence

> We are, as a species, addicted to story. Even when the body goes to sleep, the mind stays up all night, telling itself stories.  
**The storytelling animal: how stories make us human, Jonathan Gottschall, 2012**

The power of sharing stories is [well documented](https://www.iriss.org.uk/resources/insights/role-personal-storytelling-practice). Stories can sometimes be dismissed as anecdotes or thought of as sitting at the bottom of evidence hierarchies. However, they are vital to help us deepen our understanding of our experiences and those of others. This is perhaps especially true and valuable [during a global pandemic](https://www.scie.org.uk/care-providers/coronavirus-covid-19/blogs/covid-19-stories).

Story as a form of evidence is also fitting for a project focused on a personal outcomes approach. Identifying personal outcomes involves gathering information about what an individual describes as being important to them in life, any barriers they are facing, and understanding the meaning they attach to these factors. It is important to understand a person’s story in order to uncover and support what matters most to them.

## How did people feel about sharing their stories?

The storytellers were asked about the impact of telling these stories. All responded positively, feeling the project had given them valuable opportunities to share their story, and learn from those of others. Some appreciated the opportunity to reflect and ‘take a step back’, while for others it was a way to help them process the trauma they had experienced.

> It’s good to reflect on this journey and think about how far we have come, and think about the things we have gained, as well as the things we have lost  
**Sally**

> It has made me pay more attention to the dynamics within my family and it is cathartic to get it down on paper  
**Denise**

> It’s been really nice to reflect on what this period has really been like for me. I have thought about it a lot but this has felt like I have been given a platform to voice my feelings. Thanks.  
**Paula**

> Being able to share the learning and read how other people have adapted to working during this pandemic has been invaluable.  
**Keir**

There was an awareness that what we’re living through had historical importance and it was vital to capture these experiences for the future.

> This project is a bit like Samuel Pepys diary.  
**Wilma**

> I feel that telling my story - it’s a bit like contributing to a time capsule... this will pass in time and people will want to learn about how this was and how we got through it. It’s good to contribute to that in a small way.  
**Muriel**

# Context: How do the story themes resonate with other research?

There are similarities between the key experiences described in the stories with other (survey-based) research conducted in 2020 by Community Care ([surveys](https://www.communitycare.co.uk/2020/05/28/social-workers-say-coronavirus-negatively-affected-services-people-they-support/)), the Scottish Government ([Everyone Matters) ](https://www.imatter.scot/media/1947/everyone-matters-pulse-survey-national-report-2020-final-version.pdf )and ARC Scotland ([We’re All in This Togethe](https://arcscotland.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Were-all-in-this-together-The-impact-of-Covid-19-on-the-future-of-social-care.pdf)r). Some key similarities from across these three sources include:

* Staff felt motivated, committed and proud of their work during lockdown
* Support from colleagues and managers was key to staff motivation and wellbeing
* Collaborative working being identified as one of the good things to come out of the pandemic
* Staff were pleasantly surprised at the adaptability of supported people during this time
* Improved partnership working - key enablers being a shared vision and information sharing
* Staff enjoying more flexibility (including working from home), regular communication and welcoming technology, while also being concerned about the digital divide.
* In research conducted later in the year staff reported exhaustion, fatigue and worries about the future.
* A hope for the future to move away from prescriptive, service-led interventions towards a more flexible, person-centred approach.

Concerns raised in our stories about the impact of COVID-19 on existing poverty, food insecurity and deprivation are also widely recognised in other research, for example, [The Health Foundation report on health inequalities](https://www.health.org.uk/publications/long-reads/will-covid-19-be-a-watershed-moment-for-health-inequalities); [GPs at the deep end report 36](https://www.gla.ac.uk/media/Media_728030_smxx.pdf), and [Oxfam research on carers](https://policy-practice.oxfam.org/resources/care-poverty-and-coronavirus-across-britain-620980/) to highlight a few.  

# Phase 1: Response to crisis - spring / summer 2020

## Summary

The stories gathered in the spring and early summer of 2020 took a snapshot of the initial crisis response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Storytellers were asked to highlight how they had kept a focus on what mattered to people at this early stage; what they had to do differently and what made this possible. 39 stories involving 40 people were collected in this phase.

This section outlines the key changes that took place in the early months of the pandemic including changing roles, redesigning services, support to work online and the associated pros and cons of using technology. Ultimately, these changes were required in order to continue to focus on outcomes for people (highlighted in the text). At this stage, there was emphasis on ensuring that people supported by services had access to food, medicines and the essentials required to **maintain health and wellbeing**.  A key concern was how to maintain this provision in ways that were **safe** to both supported people and staff. An additional concern was how to maintain **human contact** and **avoid isolation**. There was also recognition within teams, organisations and communities of the need for interconnection and **collaboration** within and between agencies, and with the public in order to achieve these key outcomes. The emotional impact on storytellers and those they supported is also explored.

## Key changes to systems and processes

### Role change

The stories describe the ways in which roles had to change as people responded to the crisis. Some management roles became more operational (Alison), workloads from other roles were picked up (James and Joanna), and some staff were redeployed (June, Lesley). In one case, within the general hospital environment, there was a shift in focus to **staff wellbeing**and support in preparation for the expected influx of COVID patients (Catherine). To meet increased demand caused by the pandemic there was a focus on recruitment and training (Alice, Iain) and in some cases extending service hours (Mark). For some, the crisis provided an opportunity to try out new approaches to rapidly training staff:

> We developed a new face-to-face component of induction ‘Fundamentals of care’ which we had never had the resource to develop and deliver. COVID-19 working provided a golden opportunity to trial this in small groups using social distancing guidance  
**June**

The most prevalent key change commonly described in the stories was moving to remote and home working. Alongside the shift online was a concern to maintain two-way communication in order to **keep people informed**, and of **finding out what mattered to people**.

### Addressing barriers and staying informed

For many, urgent priorities were addressing the ‘extra barriers’ to do with access to technology (Wilma) and information and communication (Lorna). Storytellers described developing tipsheets (Hilda), signposting (Rachael), writing advice and tools to support good conversations (Lorna), and setting up a new national helpline (Hamish) to help meet these challenges. Other priorities included **keeping informed** about people’s needs through research and consultation (Claire, Donna) and evaluation (Katy), and the importance of being led by lived experience (Keir, Hilda, Will). For others who were not pressured by an immediate need to respond, they were able to take time at the start of the pandemic to see where gaps and needs emerged rather than ‘rush in’ (Anne-Marie).

### Rethink, redesign

The pandemic meant quickly accelerating digital plans to keep people **connected** and the crisis response was characterised by shifting from face to face / in-person support to relying on communication technology, namely the internet and phone. A key feature of this shift was that support had to be redesigned to fit with remote ways of connecting. The stories describe how a range of aspects of service delivery had to be rethought including: engagement and outreach (Keir, Will, Donna); counselling sessions and evaluation (Paula); advice services (Hamish); work programmes (Fatima); and practice learning and assessment for students (Gillian).  Policies and procedures to provide a framework for practice also had to be redeveloped and quickly shared (Kate). Personal outcomes were a key driver. For example, the ‘Help the helpers’ programme described in John’s story focused on how to help people (workers and community members) ‘**articulate and name their desired outcomes** and wishes’. It was noted that the adaptation required to develop new systems and structures brought a lot of extra work and demands (Keir, Donna).

One of the key reasons for switching to online was to facilitate the mass adaptation of people across sectors working from home, which was met with mixed responses from staff.

[Alison: ‘I lot of what we did changed overnight’](https://soundcloud.com/iriss/alison-rethink/s-2y6jYwOE3T8)

### Challenging assumptions about technology

The shift online challenged a number of assumptions and fears to do with practitioners' ability to use the technology, what kind of support might still work virtually and how receptive or otherwise those accessing support would be to engaging online. With caveats, most storytellers could see benefits and were at least partly reassured:

> Given the emotive nature of our work, digital meetings had not been considered before. COVID required completely changing our approach to engagement… There was fear to start, partly because of my lack of tech skills but also fear about being able to **genuinely engage**, being able to make eye contact, reading non-verbal communication…  
**Keir**

The fast pace of switching to using technology was in contrast to the traditional slow and steady approach to gradually onboarding staff and those receiving support (Lisa). It meant that some felt ‘thrown in at the deep end’ (Paula) and ‘a bit lost’ (Donna), although for others this shift also slowed time down (John Paul, Paula). Some practitioners were pleasantly surprised, finding that they could not only adapt quickly to the technology but, importantly, **engage meaningfully** even when dealing with sensitive issues.

> This COVID lockdown has actually really **boosted my confidence** in using different methods to counsel people. Turns out it’s nowhere near as daunting as I thought it would be!  
**Paula**

>... I have found it relatively easy to form meaningful connection and trusting relationships online with people on a face-to-face communication over Zoom - when the technology works!  
**John Paul**

> We are supporting people who are sharing traumatic experiences.  It is not a substitute for face-to-face engagement. But for now key learning is that it is possible to learn and **share safely online**  
**Keir**

With regard to their own sense of connectedness, most storytellers viewed the switch to online as necessary if not ideal. Technology meant that they **didn’t feel isolated** (Paula) and it provided a ‘lifeline’ to other colleagues (Children and families worker). While we go on to consider some of the limitations identified with providing services online, practitioners identified many ways in which online access was helping with reaching supported people.  

[Keir: ‘Providing that safe online environment has been absolutely indispensable’](https://soundcloud.com/iriss/keir-safety/s-6m5zeU3TVFh)

### Benefits of technology - accessibility and staying connected

A benefit of using technology during this time meant more easily reaching those in rural and remote areas (Claire, John), people with disabilities (John), some carers including young carers (Mark), and increased engagement with patients where there are physical, practical and psychological barriers (Lorna, Joanna and James, Hilda). The role of technology to help **address social isolation** (Claire) and to support remote learning (Wilma) was more important than ever.

Some storytellers noted **better engagement** and **more confidence** from those they supported (Bryony, Mark) and increased interest in virtual group work over face-to-face sessions (Kate). It was also identified that people took more care to take turns in conversations, as speaking over each other was less feasible in a Zoom meeting than it would be sitting round a table (Will).  Some stories included examples of where people with lived experience enjoyed the new opportunity to take part in informal social sessions alongside work meetings (Keir, Mark).  

The stories described efforts to ensure internet access and equipment was provided for supported people and for staff (Bryony, Mark, Kate, Julie). Media coverage also played an important role in raising awareness of particularly excluded groups and was linked to donations and pro bono legal support.

> [Media coverage] has highlighted the significance of digital exclusion... This has resulted in tangible changes taking place quickly such as installation of internet access in refuge accommodation and provision of equipment…  
**Kate**

At this stage, it was identified in one area at least that the deaf community was supported by the interpretation, electronic note taking and other communications support community, who volunteered time, skills and technology to make real-time note-taking and verbal communication accessible and fast (Rachael).  This same storyteller appreciated that the implications of mask-wearing for lipreading were widely recognised.

### Challenges of technology: inequalities and exclusion

The pandemic put a spotlight on ways in which some groups were further excluded from participation and accessing support because of a lack of hardware, outdated software and/or lack of internet access with concerns about how to address this (Will, Catherine). In the school context, there was concern to find ways of **making sure that parents for whom English is a second language were not excluded** (Wilma).

Although not a strong theme at this early stage, it was already emerging that for some, engaging online was not working as well as for others (Hilda, Brony):

> These are extremely stressful and confusing times for any child, however for Seal’s children who have autism and other social and emotional needs, a change towards a virtual world has been a lot more challenging  
**Bryony**

Although internet technology dominated many of the narratives, the stories also emphasised the importance of using the phone to keep in touch with more isolated groups, including the welfare call service described in Katy’s story and the thousands of wellbeing calls made by the volunteers in Alison’s story. Yet concerns remained about people who had not yet been reached (Catherine, Alice).

[Wilma: ‘I’m conscious of the digital divide Covid has exposed’](https://soundcloud.com/iriss/wilma-digitaldivide/s-mGE00QU8Bmn)

## Priority outcomes for people

There were variations in the stories about the outcomes practitioners focused on. This prioritisation was partly associated with existing roles and remits of the relevant organisations.  It was also largely shaped by a collective sense of what mattered most in a crisis situation.  At this early stage, systems were changing to keep up with the unfolding pandemic, practical and emotional impacts were being navigated and staff were being equipped to work remotely. In this context, **immediate health and wellbeing** were predominant concerns.

We already touched on the need to ensure that **people were informed** which involved significant efforts for many organisations, and which was necessary to ensure that people were able to understand risk and associated precautions, including use of protective equipment to continue to **stay safe** during a pandemic.  Beyond this, there was a resurfacing of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs in social media, with an understanding that attention needed to be paid to the fundamentals of life, as well as the more relational aspects of staying connected.

### Practical support to maintain health and wellbeing

As identified above, a key priority was making sure the essentials of life required to **stay healthy** were available to those who were socially isolating and/or who were already dependent on services to access food and medicine for example (Alison, Muriel, Alice).  In the statutory sector this focus on essentials extended to emergency support issues and ‘base level’ needs such as electricity and gas (local authority social worker), although early concerns about increased poverty was also mentioned. In one service which was set up specifically in response to the pandemic, efforts were made to ensure that practical help for older people – shopping, prescriptions, hearing aid batteries – was offered pro-actively to people who were identified as potentially being in need of support (Katy). In one area, an existing community based project ‘Compassionate Inverclyde’ which is run by volunteers switched from providing ‘back home boxes’ for people going home from hospital to direct provision of nightwear and toiletries to people admitted to hospital (whose relatives couldn’t visit). They also redirected efforts to provide isolation boxes for those people unable to get out and about and to collect prescriptions (Alison).

While most of our stories were from the third sector, we also had examples of NHS provided services re-directing efforts to ensure people were **supported to maintain their health** through provision of online options alongside essential face-to-face provision (Lorna, Joanna and James).  Some of the storytellers identified specific roles with regard to provision of PPE (Anne-Marie).  

### Keeping a focus on connection  

{{< vimeo 526021198 >}}

The practical focus on delivering food, medicines and maintenance of utilities to make sure people were able to stay **physically well** provided points of connection with people. Some practitioners who were delivering these core resources also provided **wellbeing**parcels or boxes including a variety of contents such as activities, flower seeds and kindness cards for example (Maggie, Alison, Muriel), with others also providing these goods (Alice, Bryony).  

Whether the connections with people were made remotely by phone and/or online (Paula, Keir, Sally, Hilda) or a combination of the former with some deliveries or face-to-face meetings (local authority social worker, Alison, Maggie), practitioners always took the opportunity to check in on people and make sure they were **well in a wider sense**.  

The impact of ‘every interaction and conversation’ was more apparent and conversations, a cornerstone of a personal outcomes approach, were prioritised:

> Doorstep conversations are now part of my working week and in some ways, they have helped me get to know families better, and conversations have turned to what really matters in the here and now…  
**Maggie**

In the school and higher education settings, the importance of **staying connected**to support the wellbeing, as well as the continued learning opportunities of pupils and students, were identified as key priorities (John Paul, Wilma, Gillian). This emphasis on **keeping connected and mitigating isolation** was a broadly identified priority (family support worker 1, Alice, Katy); with some storytellers identifying that they quickly harnessed the opportunities identified by social media (Bryony, Claire, Donna, Hilda).

Denise, an unpaid carer, provided a personal perspective which illustrated how the pandemic and the first lockdown presented a new caring situation for her.  She described how her mother usually visited from London for three weeks at most. Because of the crisis, Denise’s mother Betty’s stay was extended to over three months. Although Denise herself has MS and can become fatigued, at this stage the situation was manageable because Denise’s young adult offspring were furloughed and able to share the care.

### Relationships in practice and changing boundaries

Relationships were prioritised differently depending on the context practitioners were working in. A local authority social worker felt relational-based work had to be ‘scaled back to ensure financial worries are kept as the priority’ (LA SW) while Theresa, working in a care home, found ‘relationship care has been the priority at this time’, made easier due to the reduced footfall through the home. Some storytellers identified new opportunities to **engage with and build relationships with families,** as well as the people they usually supported, and that this was facilitated by online engagement in family homes (Bryony) and care homes (Theresa).

Between staff and supported people there was a sense that boundaries had begun to blur between the personal and professional (Maggie, Sandy). In continuing a programme of work on reducing gambling harm, it was noted that the power dynamic between managers and people with lived experience was flattened in online meetings, as suits were no longer worn and clothing differences reduced (Will).

[Sandy: ‘It’s affected us all’](https://soundcloud.com/iriss/sandy-sharedexp/s-1tEH74eKPKS)

### Making a contribution and community connections

Some storytellers identified that people they supported were keen to **make a contribution** to others in need at this time.  The stories praise the response and reciprocity of communities and volunteers in meeting the needs of people through the pandemic (Muriel, Alice, Katy, Theresa). Some community-oriented services were identified as having reached further into ‘communities relatively disconnected until now’ (Alice, Fatima) as a result of the pandemic. There was a sense that **skills and confidence** had been enhanced in communities, with services users more able to ‘**help, contribute and run things for themselves**’ (Fatima).  There’s also an awareness that communities have changed and ‘part of the job, moving forward, is going to be researching how our community works now’ (Carla).

> Community groups and service users have been saying for a long time that grassroots organisations can make a real difference to service delivery and have the ability to respond to seismic problems at a local level. It’s good that the evidence is there to show this  
**Fatima**

## Working together

The stories describe the pandemic as a shared experience which changed dynamics and challenged traditional hierarchies within some organisations, as well as reaching across existing boundaries. The stories evidence that for many storytellers, common humanity, kindness and shared vulnerability were put at the forefront of practice at this time.

### Teams

There’s a strong narrative across the stories of people working more effectively together in teams to support each other through uncharted territory. Team working was identified as a key enabler of being able to work differently in the COVID landscape. Some storytellers reflected on the irony of improved communication and team relationships at a time of social isolation and remote working, perhaps speaking to previous assumptions about virtual communication. They describe ‘solidarity’ between colleagues as ‘the most pivotal aspect’ and of having to ‘collectively think about how social work is run’ (local authority social worker). Storytellers notice colleagues are ‘taking more time with one another’ (Hamish) and that ‘everyone asks for each other's welfare’ (Sandy).

Some practitioners had moved to different parts of the system and were performing different roles and engaging with new colleagues more closely:

> Prior to COVID-19, I was so caught up with the daily tasks and demands, there was little time for reflection...I have a strengthened appreciation for my colleagues who work permanently in the community care duty team. Their depth and breadth of knowledge and capacity to carry out complex, often challenging pieces of work is amazing  
**Lesley**

> The team of people I found myself working closely with; all have a strong sense of integrity and believe in ‘doing the right thing’ no matter the situation. All held true to this in what were difficult and stressful times  
**June**

Technology also helped maintain togetherness and cohesion for teams, **reducing feelings of isolation** for those working from home (Paula, family support worker 2), being a tool for clinical supervision (James and Joanna) and for daily ‘team cuddles’ (Don). Also, crucially, technology facilitated communication which was frequently highlighted as enabling effective partnership working at all levels.

[Don: ‘We’re a close knit team’](https://soundcloud.com/iriss/don-team/s-6URFmdm9DrI)

### Wider shifts within organisations

The stories document ways in which staff were supported by their management and organisations during this time. There was a recognition that ‘support for staff is needed more than ever’ (Kate) and online forums for staff to **connect and share** with each other were highly valued (Sally, Claire). The vastly changed landscape called for new ways to support staff and to value their work:

> We now meet weekly, have a buddy system, support staff with resources to help them work at home, offer flexible hours, additional pay / vouchers and counselling services  
**Fatima**

In terms of leadership, effective communication, permission and trust were highly valued by staff. They appreciated communication from senior leaders and managers that was regular, clear, honest and acknowledged the stresses. The stories highlighted examples where permission was given to take time for self-care (Lorna) and staff were trusted to find a work / life balance (Don). Again, it seemed that shared humanity was at the forefront of staff support from their leaders at this time:

> I have found communication with my management team and the bigger organisation very supportive...The language has embraced a very human and personal touch including self-disclosure.  
**Lorna**

Where decision-making and autonomy was further devolved to staff working directly with the public, this supported staff to **focus on outcomes for people** with increased flexibility and creativity:

> During the early phase of COVID in particular there was more flexibility with using our budget to support families with small items, Netflix cards, internet etc. These were items which would have not been freely available previously  
**family support worker 2**

> ...a lot of work is centred around processes and decision-making, based on fixed criteria...There are numerous blocks in the system and the work can be demoralising at times… Since COVID-19… our approach has been often more reactive and creative.

### Across agency boundaries

Partnership working changed in a number of ways, driven by a ‘stark but unifying purpose’ (Sandy). Notable were the ‘speed and willingness of all to work within and across organisations’ making redesign and redevelopment possible (June); barriers were ‘quickly overcome to achieve positive outcomes’ (Kate); and ‘quick decision-making processes from funders’ enabled staff to ‘pilot, try out and be creative in responding to need’ (Fatima). Storytellers described ‘truly coordinated’ responses (Alice) and working more strategically with partners (Fatima). Some stories could draw clear lines between partner support and a focus on personal outcomes:

> The excellent support and information from NHS Fife psychological services have supported an ethos of **connecting with people, being kind, listening well**. I think these additional tools and learning opportunities will support staff to have better, more outcome-focused conversations with patients and colleagues.  
**Lorna**

This new landscape for partnerships seemed to foster more equal relationships with ‘no hierarchy, no competition’ (Alison) and an increase in the ‘accessibility of government’ (Claire).

> When we have suggested measures to support carers and carer support organisations **we have been listened to** and many of our suggestions have been implemented swiftly...I believe we have been **treated as expert partners** at this time, more than at any other time  
**Claire**  

Several stories (Anne-Marie, Katy, Alice) described that approaching information sharing and governance differently enabled effective partnerships and the development of services to better meet people’s needs at this time. Further, the de-prioritisation of bureaucracy was also identified as enabling partnerships to work more effectively (Theresa, Claire, Fatima, Rachael).

[Katy: ‘This was a really proactive approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phPwy7bqLvY&feature=youtu.be)

## Emotional impact on staff

### Proud, valued and useful

The stories aimed to capture a picture of how it felt to be part of a workforce responding to the pandemic. The response was in many cases surprisingly positive with storytellers describing a range of **feelings including appreciated, validated, hopeful, humbled, confident and energised**.

> **I feel useful** - that the work we’re doing is helping at this very challenging time  
**Don**

Common sources of **pride and confidence** included new ways of working together and adapting quickly to using technology. People felt **hopeful** about building on partnerships and ‘increased collaboration in the future’ (Alice, Wilma, Fatima).

For those practitioners who found that they were able to be creative and agile as they quickly designed new services and adapted current ones, there was a strong **sense of pride**. For some this involved learning new opportunities:

> I have really enjoyed being able to use my wider skills to improve outcomes for people.  My current role has allowed me to actively undertake practical tasks and often advocate for people in various situations… I feel more energised and excited by my work and look forward to the new challenges and learning opportunities.  
**Lesley**

Staff positivity and **confidence**was also considered to have impacted people accessing support, for example in **lifting the ‘spirits of the residents**’ in a care home (Theresa).

### Tiredness and worries about supported people and staff

Although many of the emotions described are positive, there are unsurprisingly also negative experiences and emotions such as information overload (Claire); staff exhaustion and isolation (Fatima); and feeling overwhelmed (Gillian).

Despite significant efforts by these storytellers to find ways to continue to do a good job for the people they support, fear about the future for those people is also apparent, with concerns about financial impacts on families (Wilma); their jobs, health and relationships (Hilda); long-term anxiety and mental health (John Paul, Hilda); and the lasting effects of grief and ill health (Carla).

Rachel’s story is one of several which combines personal and professional impacts of the pandemic.  Based on observations in both contexts, she identifies gender issues in that ‘women have shouldered the burden of ensuring families get through COVID with their wellbeing intact’:

> … there is the extra work with managing COVID risks for family members of different ages, maintaining contact with people through diverse routes, and trying to keep a three-year old entertained and well. My husband contributes in his own way and we share parenting but I still carry most of the mental load... I would love to see more men and partners do more.  
**Rachel**

Alongside worries about the impact on the public, the stories evidence the emotional toll taken on staff and challenge assumptions about taking resilience for granted:

> I think in health and social care there can be too much expectation that staff absorb emotionally challenging events and just keep on without a chance to process things. It has taken a global pandemic to put a spotlight on this but it needs to continue.  
**Catherine**

### What helped

What supported the storytellers was self-care (Mark, Donna, Keir), as well as relying on values and integrity to help them navigate during this time.

> ...during such unprecedented times it is even more important to be clear on your purpose and live your values. That’s what keeps you anchored and able to steer a course through the complexity of it all.  
**Julie**

> I have learned that staying true to my integrity and what I believe is ‘right’ is vital and helps drive me through stressful times  
**June**

While self-care and maintaining values was identified as a key part of staff strategies for survival, the importance of team and organisational support as identified above also played a very significant role in this.

# Phase 2: Continuity and endurance - autumn 2020

## Summary

The 20 stories in phase 2 of the project were collected in the autumn of 2020. Prior to this period and since the first stories were collected, the regulations had been relaxed over summer – some people had experienced more freedom, and infection rates had reduced.  In late autumn, it was clear that infection rates were rapidly rising and different parts of Scotland were experiencing varying levels of restrictions according to local circumstances. For this second phase, storytellers were asked what was helping to **keep a focus on what mattered to people** during the pandemic and whether any changes were slipping back to old ways of doing things.

At this stage, there was a sense that to a significant extent, key systems and processes were in place with regard to technology and access to PPE, although still were by no means universally available.  While in limited organisations there had been some more face-to-face contact with people using services and to a lesser extent, carers during this time, many people were still socially isolating and a large proportion of services were still operating online.  Because of the continued limitations on direct contact, concerns were increasing about reaching those who remained out of contact, and the psychological impact of increasing infection and death rates was resulting in heightened emotions in staff.

This section provides a summary of how early changes were continuing as described in these later stories. It also provides an update on key themes and priorities identified in phase 1 including technology, working together and emotional impact.

## Continuity and endurance in services

### A sense of endurance

Stories from this phase include the impact on services and how they are affected in different ways. By this stage, there was also a sense of adjusting to an understanding of the pandemic as a longer-term presence (John, Donna). Some services were experiencing increased demand after the first lockdown was lifted and with it, pressure to develop new ways of working to meet this demand (Maggie). In some areas, demand for support had increased ‘as services have returned to normal’ and staff ‘adapt to new ways of working’. However, with this came a concern about balancing core work with staff needs in the face of a second wave (Catherine).

In terms of priorities and key concerns, these remained similar to those in phase 1: poverty, rights, relationships (Maggie); and social isolation for supported people (Katy, Alison) and staff (Sally):

The common humanity underlying **relationships and connection** of the earlier stories is still prominent:

> People have responded positively to the shared experience approach and this helps **diffuse some of the anxiety** that we have all had to bear for the last seven months.  
**Sandy**

 [Catherine: ‘What we’re seeing is more staff distress](https://soundcloud.com/iriss/cath-servicechanges/s-epxgHT5Medg)’

## Technology

During this second phase, some services were blending remote ways of keeping in touch with people, with limited face-to-face contact (Joanna and James, Catherine, Maggie). All services continued to use technology to stay in touch and what remained the same in the phase 2 stories was recognising both the benefits and limitations of using technology. The benefits of increased accessibility continued to be built on, but the risks of inequalities and how to engage those being left behind were persistent concerns.

With few exceptions most of our storytellers were still engaging with their colleagues online and while there was an appreciation of being **able to stay in contact**, there is a pervasive sense that many are starting to ‘miss being part of a team with a physical location’ (Sandy) and finding it ‘challenging and exhausting being online all the time’ (Donna). There was also an increasing concern that for some people with the most complex needs, the online environment was not good enough:

> But it is not satisfactory to us because a lot is lost in translation  
**Catherine**

Catherine:[‘There’s a huge assumption that people have the technology required’](https://soundcloud.com/iriss/cath-tech/s-A8CRuqq5L7L)

## Priority outcomes for people

### Essentials for staying safe and healthy

There was increasing concern to ensure that people's basic needs were met so they could **stay safe and well**given many were still socially isolating and receiving services online.

In some settings, internet technology was a key enabler, facilitating communication for self-management (James and Joanna). There were, however, concerns about people not connecting with the relevant services until their health conditions had significantly deteriorated (Hilda, Catherine).  Early anxieties about poverty were amplified in the later stories. Food poverty (Donna, Alison), fuel poverty (Alexandra) and managing through the winter (Wilma, Paula) were key concerns:

> I feel like we’re returning to a less hopeful situation (compared to the start of the pandemic) where job insecurity, inequality and division between people are all on the rise  
**Paula**

In addition, there were concerns that while food banks played an important role, that quality, variety and freshness of food (Donna, Maggie) needed to be attended to:

> I see people needing this support weekly and not just an occasional delivery in a crisis. I would like to see more shopping vouchers to give people fresh ingredients to cook with or a small local shop for cheap fresh items as the food bank items are all   non-perishables
**Maggie**

While by this time there had been a concerted effort in the care home sector to reduce the infection and death rates, this had come at a price of family contact, with many family members having had limited or no opportunity to visit relatives in care homes, in many cases at the end of care home residents’ lives.  Sally described a project where wooden doves and butterflies were sent out to people to decorate and send on to loved ones who would have previously attended the hospice day services. She extended the project to care homes she was supporting:

> We have shared this work with our Care Home community, who have adapted the [wooden doves] project to **connect residents and families** in their own settings  
**Sally**

Concerns about carers were increasing, with so many usual services for supported people being closed for the duration, with limited options for short breaks or respite.  Denise, who has MS described the impact of her mother moving in for a second period at this stage:  

> I was finding looking after mum intense and when she is here, I get little time to myself and because all the family are busy, I have been missing their full attention and help with mum, that full lockdown afforded. My own symptoms have been getting worse  
**Denise**

In this case, Denise was able to negotiate her mother moving back to stay with her sister in London, with immediate improvement in Denise’s own symptoms:

> I have learned quite forcibly that the connection between mind and body is stronger than I had understood before  
**Denise**

### Accessing and listening to the voices of people

Now that the initial crisis response was over, there was a concern to find ways to **engage with people to find out what matters** in enduring the longer-term impacts of the pandemic. There was reference to gathering and **acting on feedback** from patients (James and Joanna) and stories from those accessing support to focus on what matters to people (Julie, Hilda, Alexandra, Sally, Alison), including school pupils (Wilma). A focus on being informed by lived experience remained a priority (Keir, Hilda, Will), with linked impacts on **staff wellbeing**.

> The calls we are making now offer a really person-centred approach, are based on paying attention to what people have told us so far  
**Katy**

> Being able to do something tangible, to hear people feeling better and sharing **how more able they feel to cope**, keeps us grounded and positive that we can come through this  
**Hilda**

Another example of the impact of the second wave of COVID is in the primary school, where children were described as having **enjoyed being back in the school** and having developed a stronger attachment to the school as the main location for mixing with peers.

> I think the **children feel they have more of a voice** than before… They decided they wanted something to replace Halloween…It’s like that Hygge they have in Scandinavia, except we are calling it a Coorie-in week  
**Wilma**

In supporting people working in the community in an impoverished part of Glasgow, work by the Violence Reduction Unit sought to ensure that the support was informed through first conducting focus groups:

> In working in] one local community in Glasgow that faces many challenges (eg poverty, organised crime, violence and an elevated need for food banks). The purpose of these focus groups was to invite people to tell us what they needed and have open conversations about what effective support in the recovery from the effects of COVID-19 would look like for them  
**John and Kirsty**

Wilma: [‘We all walk through that door with the same risk’](https://soundcloud.com/iriss/wilma-leadership/s-mFZqwhpyz3I)

### Mental health and wellbeing

From an early stage, and particularly following the immediate crisis there was a burgeoning of online courses, resources and associated materials to support **mental health and wellbeing, resilience and recovery** in response to the impact of COVID-19.  Many of these resources were designed to support behaviour change, self-management, and the development of individual self-care.

For Catherine, supporting people with alcohol addiction was ‘busier than before’ due to the impact of lockdown on isolation and loss of family support. New drinking problems were emerging for people using alcohol as a coping strategy.

Again, storytellers reflect that virtual communication is no substitute for face-to-face:

> Text and phone calls / video calls are great for keeping in touch but the most powerful support and most difficult conversations I have had have been face-to-face in people’s closes, gardens, swing park, car park  
**Maggie**

What seems to be clearer in the later stories is knowing that no-size-fits-all when it comes to communication (Sandy) and how vital it is to offer **flexible options to keep people connected**, particularly for those experiencing crisis and severe threats to wellbeing (Catherine, Will, Sally).

## Working together

### Teams

The importance of team cohesion remains a priority for staff in being able to**stay well**during this period (Hilda, Sally) and close working with colleagues continued be a source of **pride**(Joanna and James, Alexandra)

> For ourselves we were always a cohesive team and we are now more so. We have supported each other through work and home related struggles so **we are stronger** in facing what might come next.  There is a resilience there  
**Catherine**

### Wider support within and between organisations

The importance of organisational culture and clear and careful communications between managers and staff within organisations was still emphasised (Wilma). There was also recognition of organisations modelling an outcomes approach with their staff, demonstrating permission to be vulnerable (Maggie) and ‘walking the talk’ by**listening to and responding to staff concerns** (Julie).

> ...staff are highly motivated due to the great support we received from management. This, in turn, has led to everyone seeking creative solutions to ensuring young people get the services they need right now.  
**Paula**

There was also evidence of continuation in **improved communication** and **strengthened relationships** between organisations (Katy). A sense of ‘camaraderie’ was identified in feedback to one programme which brought together organisations within one locality (John and Kirsty). The sharing of regular updates from local and national government remained important to sustaining a collective understanding of levels of risk and current regulations (Sandy, Don).

[Don: ‘It’s connected up all these organisations who must feel isolated’](https://soundcloud.com/iriss/don-comms/s-xo0QqEGIoX0)

### Persistent barriers linked to funding processes

In this phase, a return to competitive tendering and its associated impacts on insecurity and uncertainty for affected organisations was very evident.  A couple of our original storytellers communicated regret that they could not contribute a second story at this stage because all efforts were being invested in tendering exercises which could determine their survival.  The implications of competitive tendering were highlighted:

> ..the silo mentality is still very much entrenched, and maintained by the ongoing competition for resources/funding. Funding streams need to acknowledge their role in creating this division in the community and address this attitude  
**Alexandra**

> We worked very closely with voluntary sector organisations during the first stage of the pandemic. With the funding situation being uncertain for many, that has changed a bit, but we want to keep those links going where we can  
**Wilma**

## Emotional impact on staff

### Continuation of pride and feeling valued

The stories gathered in the autumn reflect a continuation of some of the same positive feelings of **pride, confidence and achievement**, particularly around the adaptation and use of technology and working together. There is still at least some sense of **hopefulness** in the stories, with most people finding that some of the more positive working conditions and team cohesion associated with **staff wellbeing** have endured.

### Emotional toll

On the other hand, as many people’s lives had narrowed, in that their direct social contact, opportunities for travel and attendance at events of all kinds remain limited, there was also a pervasive sense of ‘groundhog day’, with the days and weeks rolling into each other. Further, the emotional toll is more apparent in the later stories with a strong sense of fatigue, of focus slipping (Muriel) and of ‘continuing to be on the hamster wheel’ (Julie).

The adrenaline of the early crisis had given way to exhaustion, and this was apparent in different contexts, including in the hospital where the harsh reality of loss of life was evident:

> I would say that everyone still feels fragmented and burnt out...There is a collective denial going on.  The numbers are awful and deaths are increasing but it is hard to take it in and people are detached… It is such unknown territory. There is a continuing state of confusion and uncertainty  
**Catherine**

In the school context, the anticipation of children and staff being re-confined to their homes raised concerns, even though accepted as necessary:

> You are constantly adapting to the latest circumstances of the pandemic… it can feel a bit like climbing a Munro at times. You are trying to see what is coming round the next bend  
**Wilma**

The latter two examples were from managers.  A further issue collectively identified by several managers in the project was the challenge of juggling and re-juggling the needs of different groups of staff, people using services and their families. Some referenced the need to attend to the changing needs of their own families (Catherine, Wilma, Don, Hilda).

Emotions were closer to the surface. Storytellers described colleagues crying in team meetings (Julie), crying with people who use services (Maggie), and the recognition that ‘allowing vulnerabilities to be shared is crucial’ (Catherine). Perhaps because of the continued emotional toll of the pandemic, there was more emphasis on the importance of self-care in the later stories (Maggie, Donna, John) as a way to avoid being ‘sucked into a black hole of burnout’ (Alexandra).

# Phase 3: Looking to the future and recovery

## Summary

In this final section we draw on the third and final phase of the stories project. At the end of 2020, we recorded interviews with eight of our storytellers.  We invited individuals from diverse sectors (health, social work, third sector, education) and roles (staff involved in direct support, team leaders and senior managers) to contribute. We asked them to reflect on key messages from their earlier stories, learning and hopes for the future. Then, early in 2021 we hosted a workshop for PON members – 30 attended and contributed to this resource and added some of their own experiences of the pandemic, which are also included here. This section combines stories from phase 3 and findings from the wider project with suggestions about what needs to be built on and the importance of a trauma informed response to recovery.

On reflection, the stories tell us that the pandemic challenged previously fixed ideas of what is possible, as well as assumptions about the capacity and resilience of the workforce and people accessing support.  It put a spotlight on existing issues which were thrown into sharp relief and exacerbated by the crisis; particularly social isolation, poverty, inequalities, mental health and the digital divide. There were also disproportionate impacts on people from black and ethnic minority communities, including high numbers working in health and social care.  Equally, it highlighted untapped reserves of kindness, common humanity, relationships, trust and extraordinary responses within local communities. What matters to people, captured by personal outcomes, takes on new salience with striking similarities between the outcomes important to supported people, unpaid carers and staff.

## Acknowledging mixed experiences

In the introduction we identified that we had sought out examples from practice of where people were managing to keep a focus on outcomes during the pandemic. Although our storytellers identified diverse challenges, they all had some sense of having been able to achieve good outcomes.  During our workshop with PON members in February 2021, we shared themes from this resource with a wider group of practitioners and managers, wanting to check whether the messages were more broadly representative. We found that on the whole, the messages resonated and to some extent the positive impacts were amplified, but there were frustrations too. Starting with positives, in the following example a manager reflects on people using services benefiting from a very different approach to their support:

> I’ve been amazed how people with learning disabilities have adapted, especially given that some people we work with really like routines and predictability.  Staff going out to do home visits since the day centres shut has changed the balance of power.  Some people have really enjoyed staff going into their homes to see them. It would be good to keep some of that flexibility when day centres open back up.  
**PON member, Feb 2021 workshop**

This example bucks the trend of removal of home visits for most, to a shift towards home visits being a very welcome adaptation in this case. In another area, staff from one service area had thrived on very new roles in direct support to very young and older people:  

> I’m interested in how so many preconceived ideas have been overturned over the past year.  We have had staff who worked in leisure services being re-trained and moving into support work in children’s homes and care homes. I love the idea that many of their expectations have been challenged and some staff have found the work so rewarding that I’m not sure they will want to go back to their old roles. I don’t want to sound like Pollyanna but there is hope  
**PON member, Feb 2021 workshop**

However, as we had expected, the positive experiences were not universally shared.  Some staff had struggled to engage meaningfully with the people they supported, particularly where restricted to online contact only: ‘_I really worry about some of the families who we are not hearing from at all_’.  While the people who contributed stories in phases 1 and 2 had freedom to innovate, respond and be creative, this was not universally experienced. We also heard from people involved with adult and child protection who had found the online experience of the process inadequate and stressful compared to being in the same room.  

The importance of feeling valued was a strong theme in phases 1 and 2, and in our workshop it was identified that who was valued during the pandemic did not always feel equal.  The need for careful communications around this was evident, with a sense that  

**social care staff feel less valued**, this was also highlighted with reference to different groups within the population of supported people, and the relevant staff:

> Our staff are tired, sore and frightened.  We went from having few cases to significant numbers later than most areas and that set everyone back.  I don’t think people with learning disabilities have been given the same voice as some other groups. At the same time the staff have gone above and beyond but I’m not sure they feel recognised  
**PON member, Feb 2021 workshop**  

While the care home sector had been at the forefront of media coverage throughout the pandemic, there was a need to ensure that the focus on managing risk did not result in a regression to care homes as clinical settings rather than people’s homes. There was a need to focus on what matters to residents:

> We need to take care because it’s not all been progressive.  Some of us have worked hard for a long time to get care homes out of a medical model. That progress has been stripped back and a clinical approach is dominating. We can’t let care homes become mini hospitals and personal outcomes can help with that. I feel so sorry for people in care homes  
PON member, Feb 2021 workshop**

We can’t draw conclusions based on stories we didn’t collect, and although there was a positive account of social work practice in the workshop, it was a concern that we struggled to get stories from social workers. Where we did finally reach social work practitioners, they didn’t want to be named.  There was a sense that there was less room for creativity and limited room for relational practice in face of crisis interventions.

On balance what emerges from the project is a story of very significant change and of some changes impacting in ways that could not have been anticipated. Storytellers reflected on how this crisis propelled us forward in many ways. There’s a sense that we can’t unlearn what we’ve learned and go back to how things were before. To do so would waste the valuable learning alongside the losses that have come from living through COVID-19.

{{< /notice >}}

## What practice and approaches need to continue?

Storytellers highlighted the new ways of working, new ideas and approaches seeded in the early days of the pandemic, that allowed outcomes to be achieved for people. In the first phase, the outcomes were determined by a shared sense of the need to keep people safe, well and connected during the initial crisis response. In the second phase, it was clear that increased emphasis was being placed on more personalised outcomes, based on learning from phase 1 and in response to additional efforts to engage directly with people through phase 2.  Collectively the stories identify key features that should continue to be nurtured:  

* Supporting creativity and flexibility in practice
* Blending use of technology - capitalising on benefits of reaching new audiences while rebuilding face-to-face contact for the many people who prefer and need this
* Meet the challenges of digital exclusion and inequalities
* Flexible working and working from home
* Keep the pace of change - quicker decision making and easier access to funding
* Keep bureaucracy to a minimum
* Build on collaboration and partnership working - at all levels
* Prioritise relationships and trust
* Keep the ‘shared experience approach’ which builds on our common humanity and vulnerabilities
* Organisations modelling an outcomes approach
* Prioritise staff support and wellbeing and put in place mechanisms to assure this
* Be more effective communicators
* Connect Scottish Government with practitioners to reshape performance measures
* More direct access to resources and more autonomy for the Third Sector
* Schools being places where wellbeing and resilience have parity with attainment

Many of the items that feature in this list are echoed in the findings of the Independent Review of Adult Social Care (Scottish Government, 2021). Focusing on personal outcomes; flexibility; collaboration; valuing lived experience; developing trusting relationships; partnerships without competition; and shifting attitudes towards technology and data sharing, are all identified as vital to reimagining models of support.

## A shared experience

In Sandy’s story the concept of a [‘shared experience approach’](https://soundcloud.com/iriss/sandy-sharedexp/) captures the fact that the barriers between staff and supported people became much lower during the pandemic.  The fact that we are all vulnerable and interdependent at various times in our lives became much more apparent; we all faced similar risks, restrictions and responsibilities in the face of a silent and invisible, but powerful threat.

[Julie: ‘Strength and courage is in being vulnerable’](https://soundcloud.com/iriss/julie-vulnerability/s-HYLPEacFlsH)

The core personal outcomes captured in our wordcloud were equally relevant to supported people, unpaid carers and staff, albeit to varying extents and at different stages of the crisis.

## Collective trauma responsive approach

The stories reflect an understanding of the intensified challenges as identified above that the workforce will be responding to as we move through the crisis; including social isolation, poverty, mental health, social inequalities and the digital divide. Catherine reflected in her interview that the crisis was rekindling previous experiences of distress and trauma for people, and that her team had a role in supporting individuals in working through the feelings this generated. Given the shared sense of threat, crisis, bereavement and loss experienced by the workforce and supported people, there is a need for meaning making, healing and integration of losses into our collective future. Being trauma-informed includes seeing behind behaviours to understand the emotions people might be struggling with, and having this lens was identified as being important in engaging with staff, as well as people using services:

{{< soundcloud 999074569 >}}

[Catherine: ‘It’s about being more open minded about how people react to things’](https://soundcloud.com/iriss/cath-behaviour/)

A trauma responsive approach offers a way to think about recovery and the need for humanising systems, and supportive and reflective organisational practices. The idea of post-pandemic growth suggested in John’s story (and further explored in [this PON webinar](https://vimeo.com/433717583)) is adapted from the concept of post-traumatic growth or transformation following trauma. This is highlighted by Keir in his work with people whose lives have been affected by suicide:

> People touched by suicide want to share their learning in helpful ways to improve the experience and outcomes for others.  They want their difficult and often traumatic experiences to make a difference to others. Once they have got through the early and most sometimes most difficult phase after a suicide, being supported to sharing their story can be cathartic and support healing.  
**Phase 3 interview**

We need to acknowledge and build on the positive adaptations within communities, recognise the strengths demonstrated by supported people and practitioners, while responding appropriately to new fragilities. Part of the solution lies in refocusing on personal outcomes and on use of stories.

## Reflections on storytelling and recovery  

As well as the core aim of finding out about and sharing practice examples during COVID, the importance of stories as a way of connecting and engaging with and finding out what mattered most to people was an additional theme that emerged from this project. The multiple benefits of stories was identified in the following feedback from the workshop:

[IMAGE]

The interviews and feedback from our workshop in phase 3 confirm the importance of taking the opportunity to pause and reflect, and how this enabled people to clarify purpose and prioritise at different stages of the pandemic. That sense of using difficult experiences to help others was reflected by Keir’s story on the importance of the voice of lived experience but also by staff hopes to make things better for others, now and in the future. At the workshop storytelling was seen as very important for both people being supported and staff. For supported people and unpaid carers the importance of ‘time to let people tell their story in their own way’ was emphasised. For everyone, stories were seen as a way of people being able to be ‘seen, heard and feel connected.’  Several people wanted more support with storytelling skills and techniques, to promote recovery and wellbeing in their own settings.  Storytelling has an important contribution to make in achieving outcomes for everyone. There are, in turn, benefits to be gained from the listener or the reader of the stories in others, as one PON member described her response to the story collection:

> Reflecting on the stories, what strikes me is the change in energy levels over time. At the start there was so much energy and a collective sense of ‘right, let’s do it’.  And it’s different now, especially with the latest shock of this further lockdown since before Christmas, and I think about what we really mean by resilience.  I wonder if we now think of it more as about enduring and that we all have to recognise when our reserves are low, and adapt accordingly.  That’s how the stories resonate with me

This resource draws on multiple stories from practice:

* What benefits do you see in people being able to shape and tell their story?
* How can personal stories help us understand and respond to people's changing circumstances?
* What role can the lived experience of supported people and their families play?

## Conclusion: Hopes and learning

### Hopes for the future

Storytellers in phase 3 expressed their hopes for the future. These focused on a range of areas, again reflecting the diversity of the perspectives shared through the stories. For example, [Wilma](https://soundcloud.com/iriss/wilma-hopes/s-Pf8HzRlLo8C) talked about her hopes that teachers become better understood and respected as a result of their role during the pandemic. [Don’s hopes](https://soundcloud.com/iriss/don-hopes/s-c67HZi81Z5c) centred around an increased effort to support carers and give them access to the breaks they need. [Keir](https://soundcloud.com/iriss/keir-hopes/s-4s0BS4cEgBn)described a future with a more blended approach of online and face-to-face engagement and [Julie](https://soundcloud.com/iriss/julie-hopes1/s-vGpTWLVKZik) talked about a post-COVID world where barriers and boundaries between people have not been resurrected.

In conclusion, we give the final word to our storytellers who described their key learning from the pandemic, with a selection included below:

> I’ve learned that a crisis like this can galvanise change and bring out a flexibility in the way we practice that benefits the families we work with. Barriers have quickly been overcome to achieve positive outcomes and working relationships have been strengthened. I’ve learned that we can be creative about the way we work and want this to continue so that it becomes embedded.  
**Kate**

> I have learned that funders, statutory organisations can move quickly and have the  resources to commit if they wanted to.  
**Fatima**

> Inequalities are deeply entrenched in our society. COVID-19 has brought to the surface what is worst and what is best in our community.  
**Alexandra**

> We have learned that people are what actually matters at the end of the day. Paperwork is important, I agree, however this should not be given more recognition or made more important than the delivery of care. The compassion, the way care is delivered and the special relationships that staff develop with the people they care for all need to come first.  
**Theresa**

> I’ve learned again that necessity is indeed the mother of invention. I’ve learned that I don’t want to wait for the next global crisis before thinking to myself, I wonder if we could do this differently?  
**John**
